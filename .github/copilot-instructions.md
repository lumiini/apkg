## Goals
- The goal of this project is to create a simple package manager in go which downloads packages specified in a configuration file, and downloads them from an apk (alpine package keeper) repository (also specified in a config file), and then stages, and installs them on the system.
- To produce a simple static binary, that can run on any system
- To be able to download the packages from any alpine package keeper repository
